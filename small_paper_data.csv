2,"We introduce bag context, a device for regulated rewriting in tree grammars. Rather than being part of the developing tree, bag context (bc) evolves on its own during a derivation. We show that the class of bc tree languages is the closure of the class of random context tree languages under linear top-down tree transductions. Further, an interchange theorem for subtrees of dense trees in bc tree languages is established. This result implies that the class of bc tree languages is incomparable with the class of branching synchronization tree languages.","['Frank Drewes', 'Christine du Toit', 'Sigrid Ewert', 'Brink van der Merwe', 'Andries P.

11,"In addition to science citation indicators of journals like impact and immediacy, social network analysis provides a set of centrality measures like degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality. These measures are first analyzed for the entire set of 7,379 journals included in the Journal Citation Reports of the Science Citation Index and the Social Sciences Citation Index 2004 (Thomson ISI, Philadelphia, PA), and then also in relation to local citation environments that can be considered as proxies of specialties and disciplines. Betweenness centrality is shown to be an indicator of the interdisciplinarity of journals, but only in local citation environments and after normalization; otherwise, the influence of degree centrality (size) overshadows the betweenness-centrality measure. The indicator is applied to a variety of citation environments, including policy-relevant ones like biotechnology and nanotechnology. The values of the indicator remain sensitive to the delineations of the set because of the indicator's local character. Maps showing interdisciplinarity of journals in terms of betweenness centrality can be drawn using information about journal citation environments, which is available online.",['Loet Leydesdorff']
7,"Player strategy pattern recognition (PSPR) is to apply pattern recognition and its approach to identification of player's strategy during the gameplay. Correctly identified player's strategy, which is called knowledge, could be used to improve game opponent AI which can be implemented by KB-UCT (knowledge-based upper confidence bound for trees). KB-UCT improves adaptability of game AI, the challenge level of the gameplay, and the performance of the opponent AI; as a result the entertainment of game is promoted. In this paper, the prey and predator game genre of dead end game is used as a test-bed. During the PSPR, classification algorithm of KNN (k-nearest neighbor) is chosen to analyze off-line data from the simulated gamers who are choosing different strategies. Based on the information from PSPR, the game AI is promoted through application of KB-UCT, in this case, domain knowledge is used for UCT tree pruning; as a result the performance of the opponent AI is enhanced.","['Suoju He', 'Yi Wang', 'F.

14,"Cinematic virtual reality (VR) aims to provide immersive visual experiences of real-world scenes on head-mounted displays. Current cinematic VR systems support stereo cues, but not focus cues that are important for depth perception and comfortable viewing. We propose a new content representation, depth augmented stereo panorama (DASP), which permits generating light fields (LFs) across the observer's pupils, achieving an order of magnitude reduction in data requirements compared to the existing techniques. The LF generation and refocusing capabilities of DASP are evaluated for both, computer-generated and real scenes. Results indicate that DASP can successfully create stereo as well as support focus cues.","['Jayant Thatte', 'Jean-Baptiste Boin', 'Haricharan Lakshman', 'Gordon Wetzstein', 'Bernd Girod']"
15,"With the increasing demand and popularity of multimedia streaming applications over the current Internet, manipulating MPEG streams in a real-time software manner is gaining more and more importance. In this work, we studied the synchronization problem that arises when a gateway changes the data content carried in an MPEG2 Transport stream. In short, the distance between original time stamps will be changed non-uniformly when the video frames are resized, and decoders will fail to reconstruct the encoding clock from the resulting stream. We propose a cheap software real-time approach to solve this problem, which basically reuses the original time stamp packets and adapts their distance to accommodate the changes in bit rate. Experimental results from a real-time HDTV stream filter shows that our approach is correct and efficient.","['Bin Yu', 'M. Nahrstedt']"
5,"Motivation: Most proteins consist of multiple domains, independent structural and evolutionary units that are often reshuffled in genomic rearrangements to form new protein architectures. Template-based modeling methods can often detect homologous templates for individual domains, but templates that could be used to model the entire query protein are often not available.#R##N##R##N#Results: We have developed a fast docking algorithm ab initio domain assembly (AIDA) for assembling multi-domain protein structures, guided by the ab initio folding potential. This approach can be extended to discontinuous domains (i.e. domains with ‘inserted’ domains). When tested on experimentally solved structures of multi-domain proteins, the relative domain positions were accurately found among top 5000 models in 86% of cases. AIDA server can use domain assignments provided by the user or predict them from the provided sequence. The latter approach is particularly useful for automated protein structure prediction servers. The blind test consisting of 95 CASP10 targets shows that domain boundaries could be successfully determined for 97% of targets.#R##N##R##N#Availability and implementation: The AIDA package as well as the benchmark sets used here are available for download at http://ffas.burnham.org/AIDA/.#R##N##R##N#Contact: gro.mahnrubdrofnas@mada#R##N##R##N#Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","['Dong Xu', 'Lukasz Jaroszewski', 'Zhanwen Li', 'Adam Godzik']"

We then prove in an unified framework that deterministic or non-deterministic probabilistic and quantum automata with an isolatedthreshold recognize only regular languages.",['Emmanuel Jeandel']
6,"In the process of mapping compute-intensive algorithms onto arrays of processing elements (PEs) an efficient usage of channels between PEs and registers within PEs is crucial for achieving a significant algorithm acceleration. In this paper this problem is solved for algorithms represented as systems of uniform recurrence equations. We address an optimization problem in order to realize the algorithmic data dependencies within the processor array (PA) with minimum cost for channels and registers. There, we use a new mapping approach which allows a direct mapping of the algorithm onto the PA by a partitioning method. In contrast to existing approaches, we consider the issue of avoiding redundant usage of channels and registers, which can appear if one instance of a variable has to be transferred from a source PE to several sink PEs. Further, a solution of the optimization problem determines the schedule for the transfer of the variable instances in the channels and their storage in registers as well as the inner schedule for the operations in the PEs. We illustrate our method on the edge detection algorithm.","['Sebastian Siegel', 'Renate Merker']"
19,"Android applications often rely on alarms to schedule background tasks. Since Android KitKat, applications can opt-in for deferrable alarms, which allows the OS to perform alarm batching to reduce device awake time and increase the chances of network traffic being generated simultaneously by different applications. This mecha- nism can result in significant battery savings if appropriately adopted. In this paper we perform a large scale study of the 22,695 most popular free applications in the Google Play Market to quantify whether expec- tations of more energy efficient background app execution are indeed warranted. We identify a significant chasm between the way application developers build their apps and Android's attempt to address energy inefficiencies of background app execution. We find that close to half of the applications using alarms do not benefit from alarm batching capa- bilities. The reasons behind this is that (i) they tend to target Android SDKs lagging behind by more than 18 months, and (ii) they tend to feature third party libraries that are using non-deferrable alarms.","['Mario Almeida', 'Muhammad Bilal', 'Jeremy Blackburn', 'Konstantina Papagiannaki']"
17,"We consider deterministic anonymous distributed systems with broadcast communications where each node has some initial value, and the goal is to compute a function of all these values. We show that only a very restricted set of functions can be computed if the nodes do not know (and cannot use) the number of their out-neighbors. Our results remain valid even if nodes know the precise structure of the network but do not know where they lie within the structure. They also remain valid if nodes know their out-degree up to an uncertainty of 1. These results are a variation of those obtained by Boldi and Vigna (1997) for a weaker computation model. As a consequence, computing more complex functions in the context of broadcast communications requires the explicit or implicit knowledge or use of either (a) the out-degree of each node, (b) global node identifiers, (c) randomization, or (d) asynchronous updates with specific properties.","['Julien M.

10,"Distributed Denial of Service attacks have recently emerged as one of the most potent, if not the greatest, weaknesses of the Internet. Previous solutions for this problem try to traceback to the exact origin of the attack by requiring the participation of all routers. For many reasons this requirement is impractical. In the presence of non-participating routers most of the proposed schemes either fail in reconstructing the attack path or end up with an approximate location of the attacker. We propose Hierarchical IP Traceback (HIT), a hierarchical approach to address this issue. HIT has significant improvements over other works in several dimensions: (1) with just a few tens of packets, HIT enables the victim to reconstruct the attack graph, an improvement of 2-3 orders of magnitude when compared to previous schemes; (2) HIT scales to large distributed attacks with thousands of attacks; (3) owing to its hierarchical nature, the reconstruction takes only tens of seconds.","['Arjan Durresi', 'Vamsi Paruchuri']"
13,"Increasing energy consumption of commercial buildings has motivated numerous energy tracking and monitoring systems in the recent years. A particular area that is less explored in this domain is that of energy apportionment whereby total energy usage of a shared space such as a building is disaggregated to attribute it to an individual occupant. This particular scenario of individual apportionment is important for increased transparency in the actual energy consumption of shared living spaces in commercial buildings e.g. hotels, student dormitories and hospitals amongst others. Accurate energy accounting is a difficult problem to solve using only a single smart meter. In this paper, we present a novel, scalable and a low cost energy apportionment system called WattShare that builds upon our EnergyLens architecture, where data from a common electricity meter and smartphones (carried by the occupants) is fused, and then used for detailed energy disaggregation. This information is then used to measure the room-level energy consumption. We evaluate WattShare using a week long deployment conducted in a student dormitory in a campus in India. We show that WattShare is able to disaggregate the total energy usage from a single smart meter to individual rooms with an average precision of 96.42% and average recall of 94.96%. WattShare achieves 86.42% energy apportionment accuracy which increases to 94.57% when an outlier room is removed.","['Shailja Thakur', 'Manaswi Saha', 'Amarjeet Singh', 'Yuvraj Agarwal']"
1,"Integration of many functions in mobile devices often results in the insufficiency of computing resources and security problems. We utilize multiple computing modules distributed in the environment as external resources, and call this processor network system “UMP (Ubiquitous Multi Processor) system.” In our previous research, the basic architecture of a UMP system and its communication theory were verified. This paper evaluates the correlation between data granularity and system performance for applications with variable data granularity and verifies the usefulness of these parameters in dynamic scheduling necessary to construct intelligent systems. A JPEG encoding application was evaluated on the UMP system with six sub-functional modules. Optimization of data granularity shows 180% improvement of system performance. The experimental result shows that data granularity of inter-PE communication could be an important parameter in optimizing the system architecture and dynamic scheduling. Moreover, the result shows the possibility of further performance improvement through optimization of data granularity by focusing on individual modules.","['Masayuki Moriguchi', 'Arata Shinozaki', 'Takayuki Nakatomi', 'Mitsunori Kubo', 'Minyi Guo']"
4,"Just as special purpose computers and mainframes grew into the generalpurpose personal computers we use everyday, special purpose industrialrobots are evolving into more general purpose personal robots. Asrobots become more capable and universal, their applications are lesswell-defined or even unknown at design time. We will have to designrobots for classes of tasks rather than specific applications. Havingguidelines for how to best organize, interface, and implement robotsystems and reason about trade-offs, as we do in computerarchitecture, will become crucial for success. In this paper weintroduce and adapt some useful notions and principles from computerarchitecture to robot systems architecture. We argue that notions suchas locality of reference, balanced architectures, and boundedness (interms of IO, memory, and CPU) can be leveraged in robot systemsdesign, and in particular, in the design of distributed robot systems.","[""Keith O'Hara""]"
16,"In this paper, we propose a semi-closed microchip which can realize the probe type manipulation in the microchip with the internal environment sealed off from the external environment. Long-term experiments can be conducted for in-situ culture and analysis of cells by the semi-closed microchip. The semi-closed microchip has a bath in the middle of microchannel to allow the insertion of micropipettes into the microchip. The bath is sealed off by thin oil film to prevent the evaporation of the solution in the bath. The seal by the oil film can maintain even if micropipettes are inserted into the bath and pulled out from the bath because the oil film can fill the hole by its surface tension. The seal by the oil film was evaluated by measuring the weight of the bath after 12/24 hours. To use the semi-closed microchip for cell culture and cell analysis, the exchange of the solution in the bath was demonstrated. It was also demonstrated that the cell fixation with the thermo sensitive gel in the proposed semi-closed microchip by fabricating the ITO electrodes as heaters in the bath. Cell culture and the target cell harvesting were conducted by the semi-closed microchip. The proposed semi-closed microchip can be used for cell culture, cell analysis and cell harvesting under a microscope as the biological applications for single cell analysis.","['Masaru Takeuchi', 'Masahiro Nakajima', 'Toshio Fukuda']"
9,"A new way to improve the classification rate of an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) could be to reconstruct the brain sources of EEG and to apply BCI methods to these derived sources instead of raw measured electrode potentials. EEG source reconstruction methods are based on electrophysiological information that could improve the discrimination between BCI tasks. In this paper, we present an EEG source reconstruction method for BCI. The results are compared with results from raw electrode potentials to enable direct evaluation of the method. Features are based on frequency power change and Bereitschaft potential. The features are ranked with mutual information before being fed to a proximal support vector machine. The dataset IV of the BCI competition II and data from four subjects serve as test data. Results show that the EEG inverse solution improves the classification rate and can lead to results comparable to the best currently known methods.","['Quentin Noirhomme', 'Richard Kitney', 'Benoît Macq']"
8,"This paper describes a study of the effects of variation of synaptic connectivity in a thalamo-cortical circuitry using a neural mass model. The oscillatory behaviour of the model output is assessed within the alpha frequency band. The model presented here is a modification of an existing model involving the introduction of biologically plausible synaptic connectivities as well as synaptic structure. Our goal is to study altered event related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) patterns within the alpha band in Alzheimers disease as observed in experimental studies. ERD is an amplitude attenuation of certain EEG rhythms when an event is initiated or while a certain event is taking place in the brain. ERS is an amplitude enhancement of a certain EEG rhythm when cortical areas are not specifically engaged in a given mode of activity at a certain instant of time. EEG desynchronisation normally blocks alpha rhythms in the EEG due to sensory processing or behaviour. The results show that a decrease in synaptic connectivity induces a time lag in both ERD and ERS peaks in the model output. Furthermore, a deficiency induced in the inhibitory cholinergic pathway results in a distinct effect on time to peak in the ERD/ERS response. These observations are consistent with experimental findings in AD. Variation of the level of interconnectivity has a pronounced effect on the ERS behaviour of the model whilethe excitatory connectivity in the retino-geniculate pathway during the resting state is more influential on the ERD behaviour.","['Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya', 'Damien Coyle', 'Liam P.

18,"In this paper, we propose a uniform quantization likelihood evaluation (UQLE) algorithm for particle filters (PFs). This algorithm simplifies the exact likelihood evaluation (ELE) algorithm, the most computationally demanding function in PFs, by using a uniform quantization scheme to generate approximated weights. Simulation results indicate that PFs using UQLE can achieve comparable or better accuracy than PFs using ELE. The software implementation of UQLE for the bearing-only tracking (BOT) model in fixed-point arithmetic with 32 quantized intervals achieves 39.5× average speedup over the software implementation of ELE. An Application-specific Instruction-set Processor instruction was designed to accelerate the UQLE algorithm in a hardware implementation. The custom instruction implementation of UQLE for the BOT model with 32 intervals achieves 23.0× average speedup over the software implementation on a general-purpose processor with 5 % additional gates.","['Qifeng Gan', 'J.M.P.

3,"High power dissipation during scan-based logic BIST is a crucial problem that leads to over-testing. Although controlling test power of a circuit under test (CUT) to an appropriate level is strongly required, it is not easy to control test power in BIST. This paper proposes a novel power controlling method to control the toggle rate of the patterns to an arbitrary level by modifying pseudo random patterns generated by a TPG (Test Pattern Generator) of logic BIST. While many approaches have been proposed to control the toggle rate of the patterns, the proposed approach can provide higher fault coverage. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can control toggle rates to a predetermined target level and modified patterns can achieve high fault coverage without increasing test time.","['Takaaki Kato', 'Senling Wang', 'Yasuo Sato', 'Seiji Kajihara', 'Xiaoqing Wen']"
